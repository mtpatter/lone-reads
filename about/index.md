You are a lone reed, standing tall, waving boldly, in the endless sands
of the bookstore.  Which book should you read next?  If you love to read
but have a hard time choosing books and think book clubs are just a little too... 
much of a commitment...awkward...Oprah-y...etc,
follow along with LoneReads.
LoneReads is a by-yourself, online book club (BYOBC)- a book club for people
who don't really want to talk to other people. 
 
## Here's how it works:

1. We choose books with a new selection announced about every two weeks on LoneReaday.
2. Each selected book is split up into weekly-readable goal chunks.
3. Our LoneReaders write short posts, or *AfterWords*, around a few key questions to read after finishing each chunk.
4. You read along with the selections and weekly *AfterWords* posts.  Drink along with our *RoughDraught* suggested drink pairings.
5. Talk amongst yourselves.  Or not.

That's it.  No organized forums. No formal commitments. No deadlines. No listening
to that book club guy dominate the discussion.  Don't have time?  Read at your own
pace.  Don't like a book?  Skip it or read from the archive.  Want more 
interaction?  Ask your best friend to be your LoneReads buddy.  Or jump on twitter
to discuss with #lonereads and tweet us <a href='http://twitter.com/lonereads' target="_blank">@lonereads</a>.  Let us know what we should read/drink next.

It's Sunday night and a LoneReaday, which means if you are looking for a new book,
we have a new selection for our by-yourself
online book club [(BYOBC)]({{site.url}}/about).
To remind you, this year we'll be reading *two books each month*, with at least
one published in the last year.  

Our LoneReads book choice to kick-off the year is selected from one of the best
books of 2014 according to Goodreads and made *The New York Times* bestseller list.
Our LoneReads book choice is *Red Rising* by Pierce Brown, 
a science fiction book with broad appeal that takes place on Mars. 
*Red Rising* has been compared to the Hunger Games, Ender's Game, Game of Thrones,
Lord of the Flies, etc.
This is the first book of the 
[*Red Rising Trilogy*](http://www.pierce-brown.com/red-rising-trilogy.html), 
the second of which (*Golden Son*) is being released this month. 
In anticipation of the release of *Golden Son*, we thought *Red Rising* would 
be a great choice to start the year.

### Reading goal

We'll post our *AfterWords* post-reading thoughts on Sundays over the next two
weeks.  

* The first half *AfterWords* post will cover Parts I (Slave) and 
II (Reborn). 
* The second half *AfterWords* post will cover Parts III (Gold) and IV (Reaper). 

You read along on your own with these goals, drink along 
with our *RoughDraught* drink pairing suggestions, and discuss amongst yourselves 
(or not).

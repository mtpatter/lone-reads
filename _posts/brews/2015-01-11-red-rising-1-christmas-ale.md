*Red Rising* was the Goodreads Choice Awards 2014 selection for best Debut 
Goodreads Author.  While reading the first half this week, we enjoyed a beer or two.

### RoughDraught Review

This week we paired a holiday brew with the first half of Red Rising.

#### Great Lakes Brewing Company - Christmas Ale

Great Lakes Christmas Ale, like *Red Rising*, is an enjoyable selection from 
the best of 2014.  It's got a cinnamony gingerbready flavor, and this year's batch
is solid.  It has an overall score of 93 on its [ratebeer review](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/great-lakes-christmas-ale/4492/).  (Why do we like ratebeer reviews over beeradvocate?  
Because we did a common sense check on the scores given by [ratebeer](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/pabst-blue-ribbon/734/) vs [Beeradvocate](http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/447/1331/),
and ratebeer makes more sense, that's why.)

Was it a good pairing?  Yes.  Why?  Christmas Ale is a really nice beer.  Past years
have been hit or miss, since the Great Lakes brewmaster allegedly ran off to Thirsty
Dog and took the original recipe with him.  Last year was a bit of a miss, but this year's 
batch is a good recovery.

Also, back to Red Rising,
Christmas Ale is arguably the best thing to come out of Cleveland, Ohio, which 
probably rivals Detroit as the lowRed of the USA.  And like Darrow, it's had a rough past, made 
some mistakes, but has cleaned up well to rise to the best of the holiday ales this season.

#### Final Ratings

* Taste: Awesome brew, wide appeal.  **8.5**
* Book pairing: Drinking a Christmas Ale is too happy for all the death of Red Rising, 
but Cleveland/Darrow makes a great underdog.  **6**

It's Sunday night and a LoneReaday, which means if you are looking for a new book,
we have selected *Red Rising* by Pierce Brown for our by-yourself
online book club [(BYOBC)]({{site.url}}/about), and if you're looking for a good
brew, we have beer pairing suggestions to go along with your LoneRead.

*Red Rising* was the Goodreads Choice Awards 2014 selection for best Debut 
Goodreads Author.  We've picked two beer pairings to enjoy while you read.
It's not drinking alone if you drink with a good book.

### RoughDraught Choices

We'll be enjoying these two beers on our nights in with *Red Rising*:

* Great Lakes Brewing Company - Christmas Ale
* Bell's Brewery - Two Hearted Ale

Great Lakes Christmas Ale, like *Red Rising*, is an enjoyable selection from 
the best of 2014.  Two Hearted was chosen for its name, a reflection on the 
main character from *Red Rising* and his dual life.  Also, both are good beers
I have in my fridge.

Will these be good pairings for our first LoneReads book?  We'll post our
*RoughDraft* review thoughts along with our *AfterWords* reading reflections
in the next two weeks.

#### Here's our schedule for the first LoneReads book choice:

| LoneReaday Book Selection Announced | First Half AfterWords Available | Second Half AfterWords Available |

| Jan 04 - [Red Rising]({{site.url}}/books/first-lone-read-2015) | Jan 11    | Jan 18   |

Happy LoneReads!

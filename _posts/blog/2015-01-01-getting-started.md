It's a new year, which means new goals, new resolutions, and new books for
LoneReads.  This year we'll be reading *two books each month*, with at least
one published in the last year.  
Now is a great time to jump on board
and follow along in this by-yourself online book club [(BYOBC)]({{site.url}}/about). 

## The Plan

We'll announce reading selections every other week on Sunday, *LoneReaday*. 
We'll post our *AfterWords* post-reading thoughts on Sundays over the two or 
three weeks following *LoneReaday*.  You read along on your own, drink along 
with our *RoughDraught* drink pairing suggestions, and discuss amongst yourselves 
(or not).  Because the only thing more relaxing than a night in alone with a good 
book is a night in alone with a good book and a good brew.

### Here's our 2015 schedule for lone reading/drinking:
